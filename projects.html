          <p>Working in an agile environments I was heavily involved in developing new and existing re-usable components for Jet2holidays and Jet2.com web applications.</p>

          <p>Front-end components were developed in HTML5, SCSS (using the BEM approach) and Javascript (Vue.js) as part of the Sitecore CMS. A theming/branding solution was also created which helped the business to personalise the look and feel for different holiday packages.</p>

          <p>After the successfull launch of the Jet2holidays website I developed the MMB (Manage My Booking) web application. This allows users to view their booking information, print boarding passes, pay the remaining costs of their holiday and add additional items to their trip such as baggage, excursions and in-flight meals.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police were in need of a website which allowed users to report crimes and incidents with ease, I developed an efficient online form process for users to find their correct police department.</p>

          <p>Episerver was chosen as the preferred CMS and a custom built front-end toolkit was created which comprised of generic tools and helpers to build the templates. The complexity required to build the forms engine and various other UI components needed careful consideration throughout the development process, I adopted a number of techniques with progressive enhancement in mind to optimise the experience for devices of differing types and capabilities.</p>

        <div class="project-card__info">
          <p>The British Army campaign was created to encourage young people to join the army at various levels, the month long campaign included several TV and radio appearances.</p>

          <p>The microsite consisted of a homepage and a content-hub page which was created responsively using the “mobile-first” approach, the homepage consisted of multiple custom select boxes which narrowed down to the individuals area of interest, towards the end of the process an application form was created to allow the user to add their personal details.</p>

          <p>The content-hub page consisted of a video slider with thumbnails and a custom tab for displaying information about the benefits of joining the army, I used custom GA event tracking for all buttons and links and integrated the pages into the OpenText CMS as part of the build process.</p>

          <p>For many of the components I used various third party libraries and developed some custom javascript.</p>

          <p>The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) Rulebook website was improved dramatically with an inviting and purposeful design and much needed functionality to the front-end. The custom built CMS allowed the Bank of England editorial and marketing team to create and update content with ease.</p>

          <p>An adaptive layout was created with SASS as the chosen preprocessor. The implementation of Jquery UI was used for date pickers, select menus and tabs. This also included custom JavaScript for various page functionality.</p>

          <p>Working alongside the backend development team as part of a Waterfall project all the HTML, CSS and JavaScript was integrated into an MVC .NET framework with TFS as the preferred version control. </p>

          <p>We tested the website on virtual machines, browsers, real devices and used external tools such as BrowserStack to ensure everything worked as expected. </p>
